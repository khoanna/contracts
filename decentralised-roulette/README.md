# 🎲 Decentralised Roulette

After an exhilarating trip to Las Vegas — the global capital of gambling — Bob returned inspired but suspicious. While the city's bright lights and thrilling atmosphere captivated him, he couldn't shake off the feeling that some of the games were manipulated. Determined to build something better, Bob decided to bring **fairness and transparency** to one of the most iconic casino games: **Roulette**, but this time — on the **Ethereum blockchain**.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Decentralised Roulette** is a smart contract-based game that brings provably fair gambling to the blockchain. Players can place simple bets using ERC20 tokens and enjoy a game where **manipulation is impossible** and **outcomes are fully verifiable** on-chain.

---

## 🕹️ How It Works

Roulette is traditionally a game where players can bet on:
- A specific number
- Whether the result is odd or even
- The color (red or black)

In Bob’s simplified version, players can bet on:
- **Even** — if the spin result is an even number
- **Odd** — if the spin result is an odd number
- **Exact Number** — a direct bet on the winning number

---

## 💰 Token Usage

- Players use ERC20 tokens to play.
- **Exchange Rate:** `1 ETH = 1000 Tokens`

---

## 📈 Payout Structure

| Bet Type        | Outcome Match | Payout                  |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| Even or Odd     | Win            | `180 tokens` (80% gain)  |
| Exact Number    | Win            | `1900 tokens` (1800% gain)|

> Example: Betting 100 tokens on Even or Odd and winning results in a return of **180 tokens** (100 initial + 80 reward).
>
> Betting 100 tokens on the exact number and hitting the correct one returns **1900 tokens** (100 initial + 1800 reward).

## 🔐 Fairness & Security

The smart contract will be designed with:
- Transparent logic
- No hidden randomness sources
- Secure randomness generation (e.g., Chainlink VRF or similar)
- Full auditability on Ethereum

Bob will personally oversee and test the contract thoroughly to ensure **zero manipulation** and **maximum trust**.
